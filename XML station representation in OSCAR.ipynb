    "When you want to adapt changes to your station it is important to understand the role of the gml:ids and historized vs. non-historized elemnets/information. In OSCAR most information is historized, meaning that this information will never be discarded. For example lets assume we upload again our station XML file but this time without humidity observations. This will not change the information of our station in OSCAR nor the station report. If we want to remove a certain observation, we have to close it, meaning that we have to define an end date of the spcific deployment. Adding information to our existant station is pretty easy by adding it in the XML file.\n",

    "There is also non-historized information in OSCAR. That means changing this information in the new XML file will update the information in OSCAR after uploading the new file. It will not be stored that this information was different in some point of time. One example for this is the date established of a station. Lets assume we did a mistake when we uploaded our new station and the station did actually already exist before 01.03.2019. Thus we will change the date established date to 01.01.1970 by uploading a [new XML file](https://github.com/wmo-im/docs/blob/master/Blogstation3.xml).This results in the following [station report](https://github.com/wmo-im/docs/blob/master/Station_Report-Blogstation3.pdf).\n",

    "Note that changing the date established date of the station has no influence on the deployments. All the deployments for our snyoptical measurements are still starting at 01.03.2019. We want to fill this gap now and add additional deployments for the time period between 01.01.1970 and 01.03.2019 or change the existing deployments to also start at 01.01.1970. For this it is crucial to take care of the gml:id. The id helps OSCAR to recognize if an information should be added, or edited, or to find potential conflicts. There are three different scenarios which can lead to different results. We will test all three of them by uploading another XML file to update our station."
