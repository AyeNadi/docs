First we will have a closer look at the XML file for a station, what characterizes a typical station in OSCAR (in this example a simple snyoptic station starting with only one observation) and how this is represented in the XML file.

    "There is also non-historized information in OSCAR. That means changing this information in the new XML file will update the information in OSCAR after uploading the new file. It will not be stored that this information was different in some point of time. One example for this is the date established of a station. Lets assume we did a mistake when we uploaded our new station and the station did actually already exist before 01.03.2019. Thus we will change the date established date to 01.01.1970 by uploading a [new XML file](https://github.com/wmo-im/docs/blob/master/Blogstation5.xml).This results in the following [station report](https://github.com/wmo-im/docs/blob/master/Station_Report-Blogstation5.pdf).\n",

    "Note that changing the date established date of the station has no influence on the deployments. All the deployments for our snyoptical measurements are still starting at 01.03.2019. We want to fill this gap now and add additional deployments for the time period between 01.01.1970 and 01.03.2019 or change the existing deployments to also start at 01.01.1970. For this it is crucial to take care of the gml:id. The id helps OSCAR to recognize if an information should be added, or edited, or to find potential conflicts. There are three different scenarios which can lead to different results. We will test all three of them by uploading another XML file to update our station."

Here we want to add that between 01.01.1970 and 01.03.2013 there have been humidity measurements as well, but with a lower frequency of 6h. We will add this information by adding a data generation block of one deployment into the XML file.
