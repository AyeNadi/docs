    "Up to now we changed simple information of our station or added further information. In this section we will have a look at more complex changes. \n",
    "First, we'll start with a simple change of a non-historized field in OSCAR. That means changing this information in the new XML file will update the information in OSCAR after upload. It will not be stored in OSCAR that this information was different at some point of time. One example for this is the date established of a station. Lets assume we did a mistake when we uploaded our new station and the station did actually already exist before 01.03.2019. Thus we will change the date established date to 01.01.1970 by uploading a [new XML file](https://github.com/wmo-im/docs/blob/master/Blogstation5.xml).This results in the following [station report](https://github.com/wmo-im/docs/blob/master/Station_Report-Blogstation5.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that changing the date established date of the station has no influence on the observations/deployments. All the deployments for our snyoptical measurements are still starting at 01.03.2019. That is where we'll come to more complex adaptations of the meta data of our station:\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to fill this gap and add additional deployments for the time period between 01.01.1970 and 01.03.2019 or change the existing deployments to also start at 01.01.1970. For this it is crucial to take care of the **gml:id**. The **gml:id** is an id of the specific elements in the XML-file. It helps OSCAR to recognize if an information should be added, or edited, or to find potential conflicts. For example if we want to edit a deployment without adding a new one, we have to use the same **gml:id** for the new deployment information. OSCAR then recognizes that the existing deployment should be changed. If we want to add an editional deployment, on the other hand, we have to give this one a new **gml:id** in the XML file. OSCAR will then create a new deployment. Having two deployments with the same **gml:id** in your XML file will create a conflict- you are not able to upload this file then.\n",
